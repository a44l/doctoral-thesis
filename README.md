# PhD Thesis Appendix

My PhD thesis "Gaussian Mixture Separation and Denoising on Parameterized Varieties" with an appendix consisting of several Jupyter Notebooks, data from experiments and plots.  
The appendix' structure is described on page v of the thesis. `appendices` is subdivided into thematical subfolders. Each thematical subfolder may contain folders `code`, `data` and `figures`, which contain the notebooks/julia files, raw data organized as `.csv`, and the plots, respectively. 
Usage of an appendix file in the thesis is indicated therein by citing the appendix as a biliography item. That way, appendix items can be easily referenced from within the document.
