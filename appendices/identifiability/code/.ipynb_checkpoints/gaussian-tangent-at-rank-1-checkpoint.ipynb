    "## Gaussian tangent space at rank-1 covariance forms\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the polynomial parametrization of the degree-6 Gaussian moment variety $s(q, \\ell) = 15q^3 + 45q^2\\ell^2 + 15q\\ell^4 + \\ell^6$. This script is to show that for general linear forms $\\ell$ and for quadratic forms $q$ which are the **square of a general linear form** $l$, i.e. $q = l^2$, the map $T_s(q, \\ell)$ of tangent spaces induced by $s$ is a surjection. As mentioned in `Section 3.3` of the thesis, it suffices to show the claim in two variables, i.e. $\\ell = X$ and $l = Y$. We know from `Section 3.3` that the dimension of the degree-6 Gaussian moment variety equals the number of parameters and is thus 5 in the bivariate case. The following computes that the tangent map has rank 5, too:"
